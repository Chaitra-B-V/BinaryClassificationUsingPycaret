About Dataset
There has been a revenue decline in a Portuguese Bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, they found that the root cause was that their customers are not investing enough for long term deposits. So the bank would like to identify existing customers that have higher chance to subscribe for a long term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such customers.
